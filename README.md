# xray-baggage-segmentation
This project involves developing an automated system using machine learning models for the classification and semantic segmentation of threat objects (guns, knives, and shurikens) from X-ray images, aiming to enhance security inspections by reducing inefficiencies and human errors. The system classifies images as safe or dangerous and segments detected threats to isolate them from surrounding baggage.
